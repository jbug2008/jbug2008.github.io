       <p>Hello! This is a writing website. I am Laura Granger, The author of these stories. I like writing about the 17 and 1800s. Of course, Laura Granger is a pen name. It is a mix of my two favorite charachters, Hermione Granger and Laura Ingalls Wilder. I also write present day stories about girls my age. I want to be a teacher when I grow up, but writing is a hobby of mine. I am a homeschooled student and this is here I will post my writings. In some of my stories, I will write about things that did not happen in real life such as my Harry Potter stories. </p>
